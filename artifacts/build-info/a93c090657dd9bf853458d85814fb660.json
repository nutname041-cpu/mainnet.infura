Requirements: - `to` cannot be the zero address. - the caller must have a balance of at least `value`.\"},\"transferFrom(address,address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-transferFrom}. Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`.
